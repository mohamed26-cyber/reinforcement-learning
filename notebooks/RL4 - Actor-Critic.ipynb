    "## <div id=\"sac\"></div>Soft Actor-critic (SAC)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now focus on a stochastic algorithm: Soft Actor-Critic. This algorithm is more or less the direct application of the Policy Gradient Theorem as we wrote it in the beginning of this notebook, with an additional entropy term to encourage exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic actor implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to DDPG, the actor in SAC is stochastic, i.e. it outputs a probability distribution over all the actions. We usually achieve this by making the actor outputs a vector of size $(n, 2)$ (with $n$ the dimension of the action space) corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution for each action dimension.\n",
    "As we need the standard deviation to be positive, we usually interpret the actor output as the $\\textrm{log}$ of the standard deviation:\n",
    "$$\\forall k \\in [1; n], a_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_k, \\sigma_k)$$\n",
    "$$\\textrm{ with } (\\mu_k, \\log{\\sigma_k}) = \\pi_k(s)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To select an action from our policy, we can then sample it from the resulting multi-dimensional normal distribution.\n",
    "However, sampling directly the action would prevent any gradient propagation as sampling is not a differentiable operation, so in order to keep the gradient flow we use the **reparameterization trick**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple: instead of sampling the action $a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)$, we introduce a random variable $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ corresponding to a noise term and compute the action as $a = \\mu + \\epsilon \\sigma$.\n",
    "This reparametrization trick is already implemented in `torch` for multiple distributions (including Normal): [cf doc here](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html#pathwise-derivative).\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRtHJvIDnw3fZ0A2_H4hp2KKhqteU1xBmRSgw&s\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "When sampling our actions this way, another issue is that the normal distribution is unbounded whereas our environment action space is not.\n",
    "To fix this, we can apply the `tanh` function to the sampled action to get a value between -1 and 1, and then scale it to our action space range.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this also changes the computation of the log probabilities of our distribution: the effect of enforcing the bounds is computed explicitely in the [Appendix C. of the SAC original paper (p.16)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05905):\n",
    "<center><img src=\"img/SAC_bounds.png\" width=\"60%\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entropy term\n",
    "\n",
    "For a random variable $X$ with a law of density $p(X)$, we define its entropy as $$\\mathcal{H}(X) = -\\int_{X} p(x) log (p(x))$$\n",
    "Intuitively, as in the discrete case with Shannon entropy, it measures the uncertainty of a random variable: it is maximal when $X$ follows a uniform distribution and minimal when $X$ can only take a single value (i.e. $p(X)$ is a Dirac).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the stochastic actor, SAC also modifies the agent objective with the expected entropy of the policy:\n",
    "$$J(\\pi) = \\sum_{t = 0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t) \\sim \\rho_\\pi} \\left[ r(s_t, a_t) + \\alpha \\mathcal{H}(\\pi(. | s_t)) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "About $\\alpha$, directly from the paper:\n",
    "> The temperature parameter $\\alpha$ determines the relative importance of the entropy term against the reward, and thus controls the stochasticity of the optimal policy.\n",
    "> The maximum entropy objective differs from the standard maximum expected reward objective used in conventional reinforcement learning, though the conventional objective can be recovered in the limit as $\\alpha \\rightarrow 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors also describe the advantages of using such an objective term:\n",
    "> This objective has a number of conceptual and practical advantages. First, the policy is incentivized to explore more widely, while giving up on clearly unpromising avenues.\n",
    "> Second, the policy can capture multiple modes of nearoptimal behavior. In problem settings where multiple actions seem equally attractive, the policy will commit equal probability mass to those actions.\n",
    "> Lastly, prior work has observed improved exploration with this objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to apply RL to this modified objective, we adapt the definition of the Q-function to take the entropy term into account and define the **soft Q-value function** which can be computed by iteratively applying a soft Bellman operator:\n",
    "$$\\delta = r(s_t, a_t) + \\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{s_{t + 1} \\sim p, a_{t + 1} \\sim \\pi} \\left[ Q(s_{t + 1}, a_{t + 1}) - \\log \\pi(a_{t + 1} | s_{t + 1}) \\right]$$\n",
    "$$Q(s_t, a_t) \\leftarrow Q(s_t, a_t) + \\beta \\delta$$"
